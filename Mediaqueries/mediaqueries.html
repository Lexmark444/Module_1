    <h1>Making Responsive Websites!</h1>
    <p><em>Media queries</em> are a great way to ensure tha tall users of a website have a
    good experience. The media queries - literally '@media' as if it's asking the 
    media a question - will ask the brower of a user avout it's current dimensions.
    The browser will tell our CSS what size it is, and the CSS will rearrange and
    repdisplay based on those parameters. My goal here is to show how to use the 
    queries, but all we want from you right this instant is awareness that the
    concept of media queries exists. This stuff is going on in the background of 
    things like Bootstrap</p>
